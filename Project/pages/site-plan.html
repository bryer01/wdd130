      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello my name is Bryer Johnson. My idea I have for a website is I would like to build a fitness website. What my website will do is teach people how to get into shape, show them a bunch of different exercises, teach them what kinds of exercises they need to do in order to maintain their physique and health or improve it as well as maintaining good nutrition while working out. The reason why I am deciding to build a website related to fitness is because growing up I always have had a goal to be in shape and make sure that my health was a priority. This website will show you a variety of different people in shape and out of shape and the improvements that they can make to maintain or create better physical gains. Can you only work out without the eating element and be in good physical health and be in shape at the same time? No, I think they correlate and are both needed for a successful body transformation.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience for my web page is teens and adults. From those who are out of shape to those who are in shape this page will give you some guidance on how to transform your physique and maintain the body you've always wanted. It will show you different work out exercises as well as some of the meals you can eat to help keep your body in shape.</p>  <!-- change this -->
